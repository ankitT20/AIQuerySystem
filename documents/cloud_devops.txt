Cloud Computing and DevOps: Comprehensive Guide to Modern Infrastructure and Development

Cloud Computing represents a paradigm shift in how organizations access, manage, and scale computing resources. Rather than maintaining expensive on-premises infrastructure, cloud computing delivers computing services—servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the internet, providing faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

EVOLUTION OF CLOUD COMPUTING

The concept of cloud computing evolved from earlier computing models including mainframe time-sharing, grid computing, and utility computing. The term "cloud" metaphorically represents the internet as a vast network where services and data can be accessed from anywhere, at any time.

Cloud computing emerged as a viable business model in the early 2000s, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) launching in 2006 and fundamentally changing how businesses think about IT infrastructure. This shift enabled organizations to focus on their core business objectives rather than managing complex IT infrastructure.
