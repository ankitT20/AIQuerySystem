Malware represents one of the most pervasive categories of cyber threats, encompassing various malicious software types:

Viruses: Self-replicating programs that attach to legitimate files and spread through systems
Worms: Independent malicious programs that propagate across networks without user intervention
Trojans: Deceptive software that appears legitimate while performing malicious activities
Ransomware: Malware that encrypts victim data and demands payment for decryption keys
Spyware: Covert software that monitors and collects user information without consent
Rootkits: Stealthy malware that maintains persistent access to compromised systems
Botnets: Networks of infected computers controlled remotely for malicious purposes

Network-based attacks target communication infrastructure and protocols:

Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS): Overwhelming systems with traffic to make them unavailable
Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: Intercepting and potentially modifying communications between parties
Packet Sniffing: Monitoring network traffic to capture sensitive information
DNS Poisoning: Corrupting domain name system records to redirect traffic
ARP Spoofing: Manipulating address resolution protocol to intercept network communications

Application-layer attacks exploit vulnerabilities in software and web applications:

Data Classification: Categorizing information based on sensitivity and importance

IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT

Identity and Access Management (IAM) forms the cornerstone of modern cybersecurity, ensuring that the right individuals have appropriate access to organizational resources:

Authentication mechanisms verify user identity through multiple factors:

Something You Know: Passwords, PINs, and security questions
Something You Have: Tokens, smart cards, and mobile devices
Something You Are: Biometric factors including fingerprints, facial recognition, and voice patterns
Somewhere You Are: Location-based authentication using GPS or network information
Something You Do: Behavioral biometrics analyzing typing patterns and device usage

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) combines multiple authentication factors to significantly enhance security beyond traditional password-based systems.

Authorization controls determine what authenticated users can access:

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Assigning permissions based on user roles within organizations
Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC): Dynamic access decisions based on user, resource, and environmental attributes
Mandatory Access Control (MAC): System-enforced access controls based on security classifications
Discretionary Access Control (DAC): User-controlled access permissions for owned resources

Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions improve user experience while maintaining security by allowing users to authenticate once and access multiple applications without repeated logins.

CRYPTOGRAPHY AND DATA PROTECTION

Cryptographic technologies provide fundamental mechanisms for protecting data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity:

Symmetric Encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption:

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES): Widely adopted symmetric encryption algorithm
Data Encryption Standard (DES) and Triple DES: Legacy encryption standards
Symmetric algorithms are efficient for large data volumes but require secure key distribution

Asymmetric Encryption employs paired public and private keys:

RSA: Widely used for secure key exchange and digital signatures
